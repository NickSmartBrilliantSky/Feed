      "Content": "In addition to the other planned developments we are running an additional community engagement challenge for the next couple of months. It's called 'Road to release' and the goal is to bring the community together across discord, the forum, the steam forum and reddit as well as increasing the reach of our social media channels (facebook and twitter). For every 5K followers we add across those six channels we are releasing an extra little thank you. In this patch you'll find the ability to mirror prefabs which is really neat. If we reach our target for the release cycle two you will find 'Walker Feet' to allow mechanical walkers to function much better on land developed in that release cycle. Visit the forum thread (linked) to find out more about the third and forth rewards. This will help us at launch and strengthen the community so thanks very much for taking part should you chose to do so.",

  "Summary": "August and September are really important months for FTD as we're currently planning to leave early access at the end of September. Between now and then we have four two-week stable release cycles planned (of which this is the first) and we are focusing on the tutorials, user interface, a revamp of the campaign and working through a few of the most requested tickets on the request tracker and fixing the outstanding bug reports."
