This will feature a developer run live competition, a design showcase with awards, all of our developers in one place to answer questions and discuss plans for month, and lots more. If you have any ideas for things we can do during this community day we would love to hear them. The date is likely to be in October as the amount of work needed for release does not really allow a day off!",
