      "Content": "Blueprint authoring the first steps towards achievements. BP authoring will add your name to your new constructs that are saved in this update. Anything prior to this update won't have any author. If you use V on a construct you will see your unique ID and your name if the construct is yours, you will also see blocks from other authors which will increase if you add any prefabs from someone else's construct.\n \nfixed an issue with mainframe naming on the AI interface \n Removed the velocity estimate of the aim point for sea skimming mode and one turn mode to stop conflicts \nFixed an uncommon issue with the deletion of a blueprint potentially breaking the UI \n \nAdded a quick edit button to save a copy of the suggested vehicle and open the designer ready to edit it \nAdded a 'tag' system for story mission arcs to allow the automatic assignment of a player edited blueprint from mission to mission \n Added a firepower estimate adjustment for each design so that the AI will be able to better select units to match the player skill in future \n \nWhen you launch designer with a default vehicle it no longer spawns the vanilla designer raft \n The effect for dying in the absense of a heartstone has been changed and it's more clear what is going on. \n \nThe display block is now fully customisable \n Visible, radar and sonar detection range is reduced to 30% for subconstructs (the detection range of a turret is reduced, so a 100 blocks on a turret is equivalent to 30 blocks on the hull) \n \n PLEASE NOTE : The diameter scaling boost is temporary! It makes ~100 - 150mm shells relatively weak compared to < 50mm, especially with HP head.Just a quick change to make small kinetic feel better in the meantime. \n \nSteam engine Pressure when spawned can now be configured (it will be the 'auto-regulated one')\nSteam engine It is now possible to auto-regulate the material burn in order to achieve the given pressure (configurable using the boiler controller UI or an ACB)\nACB It is now possible to check the pressure of the closest boiler controller (on the same construct, spinBlock, piston, etc.)\nSteam engine Material consumption is more efficient at low burn rates, and less efficient at high burn rates \n Steam engine Large boilers now have 10% more volume than 9 small ones \nSteam engine Huge boilers now have 20% more volume than 25 small ones\n Steam engine Steam engines now consume material in out of play when the vehicle is moving using steam jets or steam propellers \n Steam engine Steam do not consume material out of play for power generation if there's no turbine or generator \n\n Missiles Added a Cluster munition system to the missiles.Cluster containers can fire missiles cluster ejector units that fit(length and volume) into the cluster container.\n\n Please also check the following link for Firepower displays, QoL changes and simple weapons",

This will feature a developer run live competition, a design showcase with awards, all of our developers in one place to answer questions and discuss plans for month, and lots more. If you have any ideas for things we can do during this community day we would love to hear them. The date is likely to be in October as the amount of work needed for release does not really allow a day off!",
