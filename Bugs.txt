      "Description": "Since we added multi-threading we've seen a lot of issues with vehicles warping randomly / on taking damage/ on repairing. In the last two patches we fixed a number of these issues and in this patch we fixed what we hope is the last issue. If you continue to see these issues please follow the link to the bug ticket and report back to us.",

      "Description": "There is a problem causing older vehicle (including campaign designs) to behave erratically (their propulsion and PID configurations are  overwritten). We have identified the problem and are working on a fix, expect it later this weekend. To avoid suffering from this issue after the issue is fixed do not 'save' designs that suffer from this problem. The problem is caused by an automatic migration of settings on loading an old design.",

      "Description": "We introduced an issue where the de-spawning settings for campaigns were not correctly loaded in 2.4.8. This means that when you load a save from before 2.4.8 the enemies will not correctly de-spawn when damaged. This is now fixed for 2.4.8.5.",
